ISSUE OUTPUT (first 100 lines):
{issue_output}

GLOBAL KB (learnings from ALL previous issues across ALL projects):

CURRENT FACTORY SKILLS (can improve these):

Analyze with these specific questions:
1. Did the worker get stuck? WHY specifically? What was missing in the skill that could have prevented this?
2. If consulted, what was the question? Could the issue-executor skill cover this topic so future issues don't need to consult?
3. If proxy rejected, what was wrong with the worker's approach? What Red Flag should be added to prevent this?
4. If retried, what was the first attempt's mistake?
5. What decision was made? Is it a pattern that could repeat?
6. What went WELL that should be preserved as a best practice?
7. Is there a new pattern that no skill covers? (Only if truly novel AND likely to repeat)

Be EXTREMELY specific. Instead of 'improve testing', say 'add test for empty input in function X'.
Instead of 'worker made mistake', say 'worker tried approach X but should have used Y because Z'.

Output EXACTLY in this format:

Your job (project-level):
1. Identify CROSS-ISSUE patterns — things that appeared in multiple issues
2. Check if any factory skill should be RESTRUCTURED (not just appended to)
3. Were there related blockers across issues? Same root cause?
4. Were consultations about the same topic? Skill should cover that topic
5. What's the overall project learning? (one paragraph)
6. Should a new skill be created based on cross-issue patterns?

  Decisions: {decisions}
